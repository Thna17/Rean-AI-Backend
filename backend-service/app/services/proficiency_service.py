Proficiency Assessment Service

Implements the multi-dimensional proficiency assessment algorithm that
evaluates user language level based on skill performance, not just XP.

Key Features:
1. Skill-weighted scoring (vocabulary, grammar, reading, listening, speaking, writing)
2. Exercise difficulty consideration (harder exercises = more weight)
3. Consistency tracking (accuracy over time)
4. Volume requirements (can't skip levels with few exercises)
5. Trend analysis (improving or declining)
