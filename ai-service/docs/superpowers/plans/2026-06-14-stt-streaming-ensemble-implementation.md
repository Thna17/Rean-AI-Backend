# STT Streaming Ensemble Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (if subagents available) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build one bounded-memory realtime STT service using WebSocket PCM16 streaming, Moonshine primary recognition, selective Faster-Whisper verification, and final-only TRACE-CAG delivery.

**Architecture:** Add a focused `api/services/stt/` package whose engine adapters are isolated behind protocols and whose `VoiceSession` owns bounded queues, endpointing, transcript state, and cleanup. `api/routes/stt.py` becomes a thin HTTP/WebSocket transport adapter; legacy upload and ModelGateway paths delegate to the same registry rather than loading separate Whisper instances.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI WebSocket, Pydantic 2, asyncio, NumPy, Moonshine Voice, Silero VAD, Faster-Whisper, pytest, pytest-asyncio.

**Reference spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-14-stt-streaming-ensemble-design.md`

## Execution Notes

- Real model tests remain optional markers because CI must not download weights.
- Moonshine native failures must degrade to Faster-Whisper chunk mode or a
  `MODEL_NOT_READY` event, never crash application startup.
- Silero import/runtime failure must activate the energy VAD fallback.
- The first implementation supports same-worker resume only; deploy one worker
  or sticky routing for `/api/v1/stt/stream`.
- Browser/mobile capture changes are outside this repository and require a
  separate client implementation.
