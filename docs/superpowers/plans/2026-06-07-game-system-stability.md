# Game System Stability Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (if subagents available) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan. Steps use checkbox (`- [x]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Make all six games stable end to end, align Flutter/backend contracts, enforce server-authoritative XP and rank rules, and deliver accessible error-tolerant game screens.

**Architecture:** Backend game endpoints issue persisted game sessions and return canonical payloads. A completion endpoint verifies session-bound results and delegates all XP, rank, leaderboard, streak, and achievement mutations to a transactional XP service. Flutter parses one canonical model per game, submits session results, and renders explicit loading, error, award, and retry states.

**Tech Stack:** Flutter/Dart, Riverpod, Dio, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy async, PostgreSQL, Alembic, Redis, pytest, flutter_test.

---

## Scope And Exit Criteria

This plan covers:

- Word Scramble
- Fill in the Blank
- Matching
- Spelling Bee
- Grammar Quiz
- Hangman
- XP awards, daily caps, streak multipliers, levels, ranks, leaderboards, and game achievements
- Loading, error, retry, accessibility, reduced motion, and truthful result UI

The work is complete only when:

- All six games load, play, finish, retry, and recover from API failures.
- Flutter and backend contract tests cover every game payload.
- A game reward can be granted only once for a valid server-issued session.
- The server calculates the final XP; clients cannot submit arbitrary `base_xp`.
- XP, profile level progress, rank, leaderboard, activity, and achievements update consistently.
- Tied leaderboard entries use one documented ranking policy.
- Failed XP awards are never displayed as earned XP.
- Relevant backend and Flutter test suites pass.
- Manual validation succeeds on narrow and wide layouts with reduced motion enabled.

## Working Rules

- Preserve unrelated dirty worktree changes.
- Stage and commit only files belonging to the current task.
- Run `git status --short` before every commit.
- Add a failing test before each behavioral fix.
- Keep compatibility fields only where an already released client requires them; document their removal date.
- Do not expose answer keys through a new session API beyond what current gameplay requires.

## Chunk 1: Contract Baseline

### Task 1: Lock Canonical Game Payloads With Backend Tests

**Files:**

- Create: `backend-service/tests/routes/test_games_contract.py`
- Modify: `backend-service/app/routes/games.py`

- [x] Add response contract tests for every game endpoint.

Before persisted sessions are introduced in Task 4, each response must contain:

```python
{
    "game": "<canonical game type>",
    "cefr_level": "A1",
    # game-specific payload and configuration
}
```

Task 4 adds the persisted `session_id` without introducing an ephemeral ID.

Game-specific required fields:

```text
word_scramble: scrambled_word, correct_word, hint, xp_value
fill_blank: sentence, correct_answer, options, explanation, xp_value
matching: words_column, definitions_column, variant, xp_value
spelling_bee: word, definition, example_sentence, audio_url, xp_value
grammar_quiz: question, options, correct_answer, explanation, xp_value
hangman: word, hint, definition, hints, base_xp, max_lives
```

- [x] Assert options are non-empty, answers are present where the current client needs them, and XP values are non-negative.
- [x] Run the new tests and confirm they fail against the current mismatched responses.

Run:

```bash
cd backend-service
DEBUG=false pytest tests/routes/test_games_contract.py -q
```

Expected: failures identify Matching naming, Hangman fields, missing XP configuration, and malformed payloads.

- [x] Normalize response field names in `games.py`.
- [x] Retain old aliases only when compatibility is necessary:

```python
"variant": variant,
"variation": variant,  # temporary compatibility alias
```

- [x] Re-run the test.

Expected: all contract tests pass.

- [x] Commit:

```bash
git add backend-service/app/routes/games.py backend-service/tests/routes/test_games_contract.py
git commit -m "test: define canonical game API contracts"
```

### Task 2: Align Flutter Models And Repository Parameters

**Files:**

- Modify: `flutter-app/lib/features/games/domain/entities/game_entities.dart`
- Modify: `flutter-app/lib/features/games/data/repositories/games_repository.dart`
- Modify: `flutter-app/lib/features/games/presentation/screens/matching_game_screen.dart`
- Modify: `flutter-app/lib/features/games/presentation/screens/grammar_quiz_screen.dart`
- Modify: `flutter-app/lib/features/games/presentation/screens/hangman_screen.dart`
- Create: `flutter-app/test/features/games/data/game_contract_parsing_test.dart`

- [x] Add JSON fixture tests matching the canonical backend responses from Task 1.
- [x] Confirm the tests expose these current defects:

```text
Matching request uses variation instead of variant.
Matching parser reads matches_column instead of definitions_column.
Grammar Quiz assumes correct_index instead of correct_answer.
Hangman expects fields the backend does not currently provide.
```

- [x] Introduce a shared game envelope carrying `sessionId`, `gameType`, and `level` after Task 4 persists real sessions.
- [x] Make Matching use `variant` and `definitions_column`.
- [x] Remove or repair duplicate parsing code that assumes Matching columns contain maps when the API returns strings.
- [x] Make Grammar Quiz compare the selected option value with `correctAnswer`.
- [x] Parse Hangman `hints`, `base_xp`, and `max_lives` without silent gameplay-changing defaults.
- [x] Run:

```bash
cd flutter-app
flutter test test/features/games/data/game_contract_parsing_test.dart
flutter analyze lib/features/games test/features/games
```

Expected: tests pass and analyzer reports no issues.

- [x] Commit:

```bash
git add flutter-app/lib/features/games flutter-app/test/features/games/data
git commit -m "fix: align Flutter game contracts with API"
```

## Chunk 2: Server-Authoritative Game Rewards

### Task 3: Implement Pure Game Scoring Rules

**Files:**

- Create: `backend-service/app/services/game_scoring_service.py`
- Create: `backend-service/tests/services/test_game_scoring_service.py`

- [x] Write parameterized tests for valid, invalid, zero-score, maximum-score, and tampered submissions.
- [x] Define explicit rules:

```text
Word Scramble: sum XP for verified correct words.
Fill Blank: sum XP for verified correct answers.
Matching: proportional XP for verified matched pairs; zero pairs means zero XP.
Spelling Bee: sum XP for verified words; partial credit only if explicitly specified.
Grammar Quiz: sum XP for verified correct answers.
Hangman: XP only on a verified win, minus bounded hint penalties, floored at zero.
```

- [x] Reject:

```text
negative counts
correct > total
submitted total different from session total
unknown question IDs
duplicate answer IDs
unknown game types
```

- [x] Implement a pure service returning:

```python
GameScore(
    correct_count=...,
    total_count=...,
    raw_xp=...,
    penalties=...,
    final_base_xp=...,
)
```

- [x] Run:

```bash
cd backend-service
DEBUG=false pytest tests/services/test_game_scoring_service.py -q
```

Expected: all scoring tests pass without database access.

- [x] Commit:

```

- [x] Return `session_id` with every game payload.
- [x] Add:

```http
POST /games/sessions/{session_id}/complete
```

Request shape:

```json

}
```

Response shape:

```json

  "xp_for_next_level": 240,
  "level_progress": 0.5833,
  "new_rank": "silver"
}
```

- [x] Derive elapsed time from server timestamps; treat client duration as telemetry only.
- [x] Reject another user's session, expired sessions, malformed answers, and return the persisted result for an already-completed session without re-awarding XP.
- [x] Lock the session row during completion using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.

```

## Recommended Execution Order

Execute tasks in numeric order. Tasks 6-8 may run in parallel only after Tasks 3-5 are merged. Tasks 10-13 may be split by screen after Task 9 establishes the provider and repository contract. Task 15 is the release gate and must not be skipped.

## Rollout Notes

- Deploy the migration and backend before releasing the new Flutter client.
- Keep temporary response aliases for one client release if older clients are active.
- Observe duplicate award rejection, completion error rate, XP distribution per game, and leaderboard write failures.
- Remove compatibility aliases after the minimum supported client uses canonical fields.
- If anomalies occur, disable game completion awards server-side while keeping practice gameplay available; do not restore client-authoritative XP.
